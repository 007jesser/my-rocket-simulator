🚀 Rocket Trajectory Simulation
This project simulates the 3D trajectory of a rocket, including its ascent and descent, using Python. It visualizes key physical parameters such as altitude, speed, and gravitational acceleration over time.

📋 Features
🌍 Gravitational and Atmospheric Effects: Simulates Earth's gravity and atmospheric drag.
🛰️ Quaternion-Based Rotation: Accurately models rocket orientation in 3D space.
📈 Dynamic Visualization: Real-time 3D trajectory and telemetry data plotting.
🛠️ Customizable Parameters: Modify rocket specifications and environmental factors.
🖼️ Result Visualization
Here's a snapshot of the rocket's trajectory:

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-rocket-simulator.git
Install the required packages:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
Run the simulation:

python rocket_simulation.py

📊 Output
3D Trajectory Plot: Shows the rocket's path with color-coded ascent (cyan) and descent (red).
